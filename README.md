# Creel-Bus-route-and-Aerial-access-evaluation
Management agencies in the Great Lakes areas invest heavily in creel surveys for monitoring and managing their recreational fisheries. Costly aerial surveys are often utilized to survey expansive and complex recreational fisheries in the Great Lakes. Using concurrent field surveys and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, bus-route and aerial-access survey methods were evaluated and compared for the Michigan Lake Erie recreational fisheries. The two methods yielded comparable creel estimates for the 2021 surveys. However, the bus-route method was more cost-effective than the aerial-access method. Importantly, aerial survey estimates were found to suffer from an often-overlooked bias caused by the undercoverage frame error. Using simulations, the bus-route method was found to be statistical sound and more efficient statistically than the aerial-access method. However, the need of tallying all returning parties at the access sites in the bus-route survey might limit the clerkâ€™s flexibility to collect biological and other data. Cameras may be used to obtain daylong counts of returning angler parties and free the clerks from the constant presence at the access sites.

The source code files include bus-route (marked as _BUS_ROUTE) and aerial creel simulations, and true angler population trip data for several months.
